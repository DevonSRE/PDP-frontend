              institutional development partner supporting public and private
              sector organizations across Africa and beyond. We take a
              collaborative and problem-solving approach to co-design training
              programs and reform initiatives that are context-specific,
              practical, and impactful.

              Why it Matters
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-200 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              At Pivotal, we believe that institutions thrive when people are
              empowered with the right tools, knowledge, and systems. We are
              committed to supporting leadership, accountability, and innovation
              across Africaâ€™s development space through targeted learning and
              reform strategies.

              How We Work
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-200 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Our process begins with a strategic needs assessment to understand
              client priorities. We then co-develop tailored training and support
              initiatives that address these gaps. Post-training follow-ups and
              institutional guidance are built into our delivery to ensure
              long-term impact.
